This class has been a very interesting class for me.
I learned a lot about how to build applications. 
At this assignment, I had no idea how an iOS application using core Data or Firebase is created. 
The first thing I learned from this app is to use Cocao pods in XCode.
I had used XCode before for my C programming class, but this is my first time building an application through it. 
For me, I found it to be much easier to build an app at iOS then to make an android app. 
I learned swift language, which is very similar to Java.
The first thing that I learned will writing this program was how the main screen and the other screens of the application was manipulated.
It was very convenient to work on the storyboard and to at labels and buttons then to code it. 
It was very visual. The other lesson I learned was to use the view controllers and create different view controllers to manipulate each screen. 
But after watching tutorials an tutorials of building applications, things got easier.
This app was fun to make an very informative.
